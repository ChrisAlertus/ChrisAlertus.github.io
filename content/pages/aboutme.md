Hello and welcome to my website! This site is many things for me:

- a non-trivial technical fun project I hacked together over a weekend
- a place to put my thoughts and readings on machine learning / data science 
down on paper
- a place to store links and useful content I may want to use in future

Who am I?
---------

Born and raised in Barbados until I was 17, I currently live in 
Toronto, Canada. When I came to Canada, it was to attend the 
University of Waterloo for their joint program with Wilfrid Laurier University 
in Mathematics and Business Administration.

There I got exposure to Combinatorics and Optimization, Graph Theory and 
Game Theory, Computer Science, Computational Mathematics and Statistics. 
I dabbled in all the fields throughout my undergrad while also self-studying 
Machine Learning on my own and it all led me to today where I currently 
do Data Science work at a major Canadian telco.

Interests
---------

Professional: 

* Causal Inference
* Differential privacy
* Representation learning
* Video stream Classification

Personal:

* Football (soccer)
* Running (completed the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 2016 and 2018)
* Salsa and Bachata dancing
* Music: jazz, salsa, bachata, reggaeton, dancehall, soca

I am fascinated by the AI field and constantly humbled by how much there is 
to know in the field and the extent to my own ignorance. 

The successes seen in recent years prove that the technology can and will have
a tremendous impact on our daily lives. This motivates me to keep striving and
working at my skills in order to capitalize on the opportunities to make 
meaningful, positive impacts on the world and society.
